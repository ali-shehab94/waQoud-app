Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack used to build waQoud:

-   This project uses the [React Native Framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native is a JavaScript-based mobile app framework that allows you to build natively-rendered mobile apps for iOS and Android. The framework lets you create an application for various platforms by using the same codebase.
-   For persistent storage (database), the app uses the [Hive](https://hivedb.dev/) package which allows the app to create a custom storage schema and save it to a local database.
-   To send local push notifications, the app uses the [flutter_local_notifications](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_local_notifications) package which supports Android, iOS, and macOS.
    -   ðŸš¨ Currently, notifications aren't working on macOS. This is a known issue that we are working to resolve!
-   The app uses the font ["Work Sans"](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
