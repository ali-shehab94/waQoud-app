Here's a brief high-level overview of the tech stack used to build waQoud:

-   This project uses the [React Native Framework](https://reactnative.dev/). React Native is a framework for building native apps using React. It can be used to develop applications that target anything from Android, iOS devices to Windows systems.
-   For reliability, the app uses [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) database with a firm structure to allow scalability.

-   The app uses the font [Righteous](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans) as its main font, and the design of the app adheres to the material design guidelines.
